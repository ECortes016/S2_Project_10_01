/* The video element is set to a width of 90% with it being centered horizontally by stylizing the margins. A media query was added for devices who's minimum width is 521px, which will then be floated to the right side and have a margin of 10px on all sides. The captions were targeted using the ::cue which allowed for the 1.3em font size and background color and font color change. */
